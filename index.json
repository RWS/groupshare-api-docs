Anyone is welcome to contribute to the public Groupshare API documentation by making a pull request into the master repository. The documentation is split into the following sections: Articles This section hosts a series of usefull article on: how to get started with writing plug-ins for Groupshare how to best use the public APIs how to troubleshoot common issues API Concepts This section hosts the main guidelines on using the Public API along with the API References Getting started with your contribution The documentation is built using a static documentation generator called DocFX. The documentation content is saved in Markdown files and then built into a website using DocFX. The table of content is saved into separate toc.yml files. In order for you to make a contribution directly please follow the next steps: Create a local branch from the main repository Add your changes by modifying existing Markdown files or by adding new Markdown files Adding new files will require updating the toc.yml files. Use the guideline provided by DocFX to learn more. You can use tools such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code to edit the content Create a Pull Request with your changes. This pull request will be reviewed for correctness by one of our technical writers Once your pull request has been approved and committed into the main branch, an automatic pipeline will be triggered which will push your changes to the live documentation site if you wish to test your changes locally you can follow the DOCFX Installation guideline and build the entire solution locally Our documentation automatically fills in the product name and other details so you don't have to make the changes manually if we decide to update the product name. Use the 'var:VariableName' construct to tell our documentation engine to fill in the info for you. Here are the constructs available at this point: Var:ProductName - The product name, for example Groupshare Var:ProductNameWithEdition - The official product release name including the edition, for example 'Groupshare 2020'"

    "summary": "GroupShare API Documentation Introduction This page contains links to the available resources you'll need to work with the current version of the GroupShare REST API. Through the use of the REST Web API 3rd party developers can extend the GroupShare eco-system. Your applications can integrate with GroupShare using simple HTTP methods - supporting JSON format. All the calls in this specifications are OAuth 2.0 protected resources. This means that callers must provide a so called \"bearer token\". This token can be obtained by issuing a POST request, to the authentication/api/1.0/login URL (see the Login section of the GroupShare Web API). The received token can be used to get access to the associated resources (all of the exposed API calls). The API documentation is currently split into two parts: The GroupShare Web API The TM Service API GroupShare Web API This includes the documentation for authentication, user management, project management and terminology management. The documentation can be found in your implementation of GroupShare at [servername.domain]/documentation/api/index. For example, you can find the current version on our development test server here: https://groupsharedev.sdlproducts.com/documentation/api/index TM Service API This includes the documentation for Translation Memory management. The documentation can be found in your implementation of GroupShare at [servername.domain]/docs/ui/index. For example, you can find the current version on our development test server here: https://groupsharedev.sdlproducts.com/docs/ui/index GroupShareKit To provide an easy way to interact with the REST API above we have created the GroupShareKit which is a client library targeting .NET 4.6 and above. It currently supports two versions: GroupShareKit GroupShareKit-2017 This can be found here: https://github.com/sdl/groupsharekit.net We have also created a sample web application using the GroupShareKit. The source code of the application is available here : https://github.com/sdl/GroupShareKit-Sample Additional helpful resources Video exploring the use of Swagger with the GroupShare REST API There is also a useful video here on how to work with the REST APIs and the swagger page. It is based on working with the 2017 version of GroupShare, but the principles are the same: GroupShare Api endpoints step by step This wiki in the Language Developers forum on the RWS Community explains everything you need to know about working with the GroupShare API endpoints: https://community.sdl.com/developers-more/developers/language-developers/w/wiki/3395.groupshare-api-endpoints-step-by-step GroupShare WebHooks Service WebHooks provide a publish / subscribe model for wiring together Web APIs and services. You can subscribe to GroupShare events and get notified when that event happens through a callback. This wiki in the Language Developers forum on the RWS Community explains: https://community.sdl.com/developers-more/developers/language-developers/w/wiki/3388.groupshare-webhooks-service Where to get further help If you have any questions on any of the GroupShare APIs the best place to ask is in the community here: https://community.sdl.com/developers-more/developers/language-developers/f/sdk_qa"
